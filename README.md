GPIOs, A/D Converter, temperature sensor, light sensor, PWM, fan and a speaker, timer and counters, system interrupts, TFT interface, I2C bus, SPI bus, RTC, IR remote control

This project deals with what is mentioned above to integrate a design that has the following functions and more:
-A TFT panel used as a main display
-An ambient temperature in degree C and F is displayed on the screen
-A digital clock shows the time and date
-A fan support with full function control (On/Off & speed)
-An indicator of the duty cycle for the fan control
-An alarm function is available to activate a multicolor LED when the alarm set time is reached
-A remote control used to setup the actual time, the alarm time, and the set temperature for a heater control(represented by the fan)
-A push-button switch used to enable the Alarm function

The hardware schematics is provided as a pdf file, as well as some more usefull documentations.
More descriptions for the code and the hardware is available in private.
This project is made possible thanks to my professor FP, who also provided the development board he made himself.
